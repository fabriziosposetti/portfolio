                <p>Hi, this is Fabrizio. I'm a Software Engineer. I was born in 1993 in Cordoba, Argentina. I grew up
                    there.
                    I graduated from National Technological University in System Engeneering.
                    Passionate about the tecnology and challenges.
                    Always looking for professional and personal development.
                    In my free time, I love to practice sports.

                <p>I did an internship in systems audit during my last
                    year at University. I have worked there for 1 year and I learned
                    a lot because it was my first job.</p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working at SimTLiX as a software developer.
                    I am part of a team that is developing an iOS application using Swift.
                    We use Eureka framework to build forms, Realm in order to use local DB,
                    and Alamofire for server requests. Also I've got involved in DevOps and Continuous
                    Integration tasks.

                <h5>Software Developer</h5>
                <p>
                    During my last year at University I've worked in my final project with 4
                    more collegues. We built an E-commerce platform where the users could change your things without
                    money.
                    It is developed on Java using spring framework. If you want to see more go to the demo in 'My
                    Work', we called it OKTrueque.
